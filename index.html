                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists in
                    creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                    Navigation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                    text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                    related to the project itself.</p>
